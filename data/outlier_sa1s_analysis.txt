OUTLIER SA1s ANALYSIS: Distance to Nearest Bus Stop > 3,000 metres
Generated: 2025-12-01
================================================================================

SUMMARY
-------
Total outliers: 9 SA1s out of 1,164 total (0.8%)
Distance range: 3,811m - 21,369m (3.8km - 21.4km)
Population affected: 1,096 people (0.2% of total ACT population in dataset)

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. Most outliers are in remote/rural districts:
   - Uriarra-Namadgi: 5 SA1s (545 people)
   - Canberra East: 4 SA1s (551 people)

2. Many outliers have very low density (0-4 persons/km²)
   - These are likely parks, rural areas, or conservation zones
   - Providing bus service may not be cost-effective

3. 99th percentile distance is 2,470m
   - Only 1% of SA1s have distance > 2.5km
   - Current chart showing 0-3,000m captures 99.2% of data

DISTRICT SUMMARY
================================================================================

Uriarra-Namadgi (5 SA1s)
- Population: 545 people
- Distance range: 4.7km - 21.4km
- Average distance: 10.5km
- Character: Rural/conservation, mostly very low density

Canberra East (4 SA1s)
- Population: 551 people
- Distance range: 3.8km - 10.6km
- Average distance: 5.7km
- Character: Mixed - includes one moderate-density SA1 (916/km²)

================================================================================
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (consider service extension):
✓ SA1 80103111301 (Canberra East) - 375 people, 916 persons/km², 4.2km
✓ SA1 80111114006 (Uriarra-Namadgi) - 309 people, 336 persons/km², 8.8km

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
• SA1 80103111506 (Canberra East) - 117 people, 4 persons/km², 3.8km

LOW PRIORITY (cost-benefit likely unfavorable):
• All other outliers (populations < 100, very low density)

FILTERING RECOMMENDATION
-------------------------
For visualization purposes:
- KEEP all SA1s for completeness and transparency
- EXTEND y-axis to show full data range (0-22,000m or 0-25,000m)
- Consider adding annotation/highlight for the 2 high-priority SA1s
- Alternative: Create two charts (main + inset for outliers)

For policy analysis:
- Consider separate analysis for SA1s with density < 50 persons/km²
  (likely rural/conservation areas where PT service is impractical)
- Focus intervention on moderate-high density outliers (2 SA1s identified)
