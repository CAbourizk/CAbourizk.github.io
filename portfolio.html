            <h2>Challenge 1</h2>
            <p>
                This week's selection of charts explain the UK's fiscal position when compared with other advanced economies.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3> Debt to GDP</h3>
        <p>The UK's stock of government debt is high by international standards, but lower than a number of other G7 economies</p>
        <figure id="Location1"></figure>
        <h3> Bond yields</h3>
        <p>10 year bond yields (one of the most relevent yields for long term fiscal sustainability) have tracked alongside other major economies over the last 30 years. </p>

        <h2>Challenge 2</h2>
        <h3> Changes in gilt yeilds</h3>
        <p>Yields spiked following the Truss-Kwarteng mini-budget, but was this just a sign of things to come?</p>
        <figure id="Location3"></figure>

        <h3> Mortgage rates</h3>
        <p>Mortgage rates were also affected, but have generally followed a different path to gilts.</p>

        <h2>Challenge 3 - The Green revoltion</h2>
        <p>Before the focus on carbon emmissions, the first Green revolution was a period of rapid agricultural productivity growth. The use of high yeilding varieties, chemical fertalisers, and pesticides has divorced growth in agricultural labour force and industry output. </p>
        <h3> Agricultural value added per worker</h3>
        <p>Countries that have been able to invest in 'Green revolution' techniques have seen agricultural productivity soar.</p>
        <figure id="Location5"></figure>

        <h3> Share of the labour force employed in agricultre</h3>
        <p>This has meant that output has continued to rise, while the share of the labour force employed in agriculture has shrunk. Developing and middle income nations still have high shares of their population employed in agriculture. This is an untapped source of labour market supply which may be useful as population's age</p>

        <h2>Challenge 4</h2>
                <h3> Cities with the best batting talent</h3>
        <p>Found on ESPN Cricinfo - this visualisation really doesnt add anything (what is that even meant to be for Launceston?) and is hard to decifer</p>
